DESCRIPTION
     Los Angeles ozone pollution data, 1976.  Each observation is one day.

     Column    Contains
        1      Month: 1 = January, ..., 12 = December.
        2      Day of month.
        3      Day of week: 1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday.
        4      Daily maximum one-hour-average ozone reading (parts per million)
               at Upland, CA.
        5      500 millibar pressure height (m) measured at Vandenberg AFB.
        6      Wind speed (mph) at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).
        7      Humidity (%) at LAX.
        8      Temperature (degrees F) measured at Sandburg, CA.
        9      Temperature (degrees F) measured at El Monte, CA.
       10      Inversion base height (feet) at LAX.
       11      Pressure gradient (mm Hg) from LAX to Daggett, CA.
       12      Inversion base temperature (degrees F) at LAX.
       13      Visibility (miles) measured at LAX.

     Note:  Units for the Sandberg and El Monte temperatures are incorrectly
     reported in the BLSS book as degrees C.  The correct units are degrees F,
     as shown above.

     Missing data is represented by "NA".
